//haven't tested all assembly commands but works for the ones I did. 

I have been working on the project since fall break and have 
been communicating with the group about what I have been working on 
it. Since then I have met up with Spencer several times to explain 
everything I have been doing in detail so I can confirm that he understands
what is going on in the machine. Rachel and Andrew told me that they have 
been working on the RAM and some other parts. Rachel told me to submit mine
without their contributions so do what you please but that is what has 
happened I will talk to you about it next time we get a chance.
